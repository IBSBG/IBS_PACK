# IBS_PACK

The components included in this package have been used and tested on Websphere Portal version 8.5 and 9.0. In order to be able to setup and use them, an administrator will need to have access to the following systems: Portal administration, Web Content Authoring and Integrated Solutions Console. 

# Main functional components

- Single Gallery -> this allows for quick creation of image gallery by creating content items representing each image. The gallery displays one main image with arrow controls and multiple smaller thumbnails showing the rest of the gallery below it. They can be edited, moved, resized or deleted in edit mode.
- Gallery List -> this one is a list of single galleries displaying their title and head image 
- Gallery to content -> this component allows a gallery to be added to any user content in the form of image thumbnails and when a given user clicks on any of them, fancybox is used for visualization.
- File Manager -> all portal-allowed types of files can be added and shown as a list to any user content by a simple click.
